To use objects in VBScript, you first need to create an instance of an object and store its reference in a VBScript variable.

Syntax :
========
In order to work with objects seamlessly, we need to declare the object and instantiate it using Set Keyword.


Dim objectname    ''''' Declare the object name.
Set objectname = CreateObject(object_type)





Destroying the Objects :
========================
The significance of destroying the Object is to free the memory and reset the object variable.

Syntax
In order to destroy the objects, we need to use Set Keyword followed by the object name and point it to Nothing.

Set objectname = Nothing 'Destroy the object.
Example
In the below example, we are creating an object of type Scripting.Dictionary.

Dim obj  
Set obj = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
Set obj = Nothing.
